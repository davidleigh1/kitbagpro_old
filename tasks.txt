TODO:

LIST FILTERS
Remove "Organisations"/"Kitbags" header
Only show "All Orgs / My Orgs" when user is Admin (and therefore has visiblity to non-associated Orgs)
Filter to show only permitted Orgs (requires expanded sub-tasks)
Allow SuperAdmins to see all Kitbags and Orgs
Limit Kitbags and Orgs to those assigned or public
Fix Sorting/Ordering
Fix Hightlighting when Filtering
